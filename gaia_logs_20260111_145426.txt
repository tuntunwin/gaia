Question Text:
Here's a fun riddle that I'd like you to try.

An adventurer exploring an ancient tomb came across a horde of gold coins, all neatly stacked in columns. As he reached to scoop them into his backpack, a mysterious voice filled the room. "You have fallen for my trap adventurer," the voice began, and suddenly the doorway to the chamber was sealed by a heavy rolling disk of stone. The adventurer tried to move the stone disk but was unable to budge the heavy stone. Trapped, he was startled when the voice again spoke. 

"If you solve my riddle, I will reward you with a portion of my riches, but if you are not clever, you will never leave this treasure chamber. Before you are 200 gold coins. I pose a challenge to you, adventurer. Within these stacks of coins, all but 30 are face-up. You must divide the coins into two piles, one is yours, and one is mine. You may place as many coins as you like in either pile. You may flip any coins over, but you may not balance any coins on their edges. For every face-down coin in your pile, you will be rewarded with two gold coins. But be warned, if both piles do not contain the same number of face-down coins, the door will remain sealed for all eternity!"

The adventurer smiled, as this would be an easy task. All he had to do was flip over every coin so it was face down, and he would win the entire treasure! As he moved to the columns of coins, however, the light suddenly faded, and he was left in total darkness. The adventurer reached forward and picked up one of the coins, and was shocked when he realized that both sides felt almost the same. Without the light, he was unable to determine which side of the coin was heads and which side was tails. He carefully replaced the coin in its original orientation and tried to think of a way to solve the puzzle. Finally, out of desperation, the adventurer removed 30 coins to create his pile. He then carefully flipped over each coin in his pile, so its orientation was inverted from its original state.

"I've finished," he said, and the lights returned. Looking at the two piles, he noticed that the larger pile contained 14 face-down coins.

What was the outcome for the adventurer? If he failed the challenge, please respond with "The adventurer died." Otherwise, please provide the number of coins the adventurer won at the conclusion of the riddle. If the adventurer won any coins, provide your response as the number of coins, with no other text.

Thought: Classic puzzle — with 200 coins and 30 face-down initially, taking 30 coins and flipping them makes the number of face-down coins equal in both piles. Given the larger pile has 14 face-down coins, the adventurer's pile also has 14 face-down coins, earning 2 coins per face-down: 2 * 14 = 28. I'll compute and return the final answer.

<code>
initial_total = 200
initial_facedown = 30
taken = 30
larger_pile_facedown = 14

# The adventurer's pile will have the same number of face-down coins as the larger pile.
adventurer_facedown = larger_pile_facedown

reward_per_facedown = 2
reward = adventurer_facedown * reward_per_facedown

Question Text:
A data annotator stayed up too late creating test questions to check that a system was working properly and submitted several questions with mathematical errors. On nights when they created 15 test questions, they made 1 error. On nights when they created fewer than 15 questions, they also corrected 3 errors. On nights they created 20 questions, they made 0 errors. On nights when they created 25 or more, they made 4 errors. Over the course of five nights, the worker produced a total of 6 errors. When asked how many nights they created 15 questions, they gave three possible numbers as responses. What are the three numbers, presented in the format x, y, z in ascending order?

Thought:
I'll model the nights with variables for counts in each category (fewer than 15, exactly 15, 20, 25+). I'll search all nonnegative integer solutions with total nights 5 that meet the total-error constraint. There is ambiguity whether "corrected 3 errors" means "made 3 errors" (i.e., +3 per such night) or "corrected" implying -3 per such night. I'll check both interpretations and list feasible values for the number of nights with 15 questions. I'll use Python to enumerate possibilities and print the results.

solutions_corrected = []

for a in range(6):  # nights with <15

Recipes
-------

**Notice: Unless you know you should edit one of these recipes, don't. You will lose wiki privileges.**

These recipes are only a starting place. There are thousands of mead recipes on the Internet. Ask your local homebrew shop or members of your club if they have recipes to share. Finally, branch out on your own and experiment!

Remember, recipes are as much method as ingredients. For best results, read the entire recipe a couple of times before you begin. It may help beginners to make a chronological list of actions, including the less glamorous steps - like ever-important sanitation!

The Beginner recipes are geared for simplicity and are scaled to one gallon batches. The instructions are thorough and assume very little knowledge of process. The rest are a little more advanced and calibrated for five gallon batches. They assume strong familiarity with process and only make note of non-obvious steps or considerations. These recipes can be readily scaled up or down. The yeast requirement may not scale linearly, however. An acceptable pitch rate is 1 to 5 grams per gallon; 2 grams per gallon is most commonly given as the "standard." Look at the packet of yeast to see how many grams it contains. It should be clearly marked.

Have fun!

###Cherry Melomel

(by /u/StormBeforeDawn)

**Total Volume:** 5 gallons

**Style:** Sweet Still Melomel

**Carbonation:** None

**Target Original Gravity:** 1.138

**Target Final Gravity:** 1.020-1.030


**Ingredients**

Ingredient| Amount | Notes
---|---|---
Honey | 14 lbs | Use a good honey, see notes.
Tart Cherries | 15 lbs | Whole, with pits. See notes.
GoFerm PE | 12.5 g |
Fermaid O | 8.5 g |
Fermaid K | 9.5 g | 
DAP | 13.8 g | 
Pectic Enzyme | 2.5 tsp |
rc-212 or 71b | 10 g | [Rehydrate in the Go Ferm using 250 ml water at 110 F](http://www.scottlab.com/product-102.aspx)

**Method:**

1. In your primary bucket add the cherries and a bit of water. Macerate the cherries with a drill stir/paint mixer and add the pectic enzyme.

1. Rehydrate the yeast using the GoFerm PE.

1. While the yeast rehydrates mix the honey into the cherries and fill to 5 gallons with water.

1. Pitch yeast.

1. Aerate twice daily until the gravity reaches 1.100.

1. After 24 hours add the first 1/3rd of the nutrients, then the next at 48 hours, and the last at the 1/3rd sugar break, 1.100 SG. 

1. Ferment at 62-65° F.

1. Rack after 2 weeks, consider bentonite if there is excessive solids in suspension.

1. Fine or filter if desired. Otherwise, wait until it's very clear.

1. Allow at least 6 months of aging, but it's better in 12 months.

1. Serve at cellar temp.

**Additional Notes:**

You want the honey to be something that will provide a complimentary flavor to the cherry. Basswood or raspberry blossom are two great options if available, or a lighter spring wildflower.

Some spices may go very well with cherry. Cinnamon and vanilla are options, and a little hot pepper can really make some flavors pop out. With a little less honey in primary back sweetening with maple syrup or molasses are both options. 

Cherry pits contain a cyanide precursor in really small amounts, like all stone fruit. When you macerate the cherries

Question Text:
Bob has genome type Aa, and Linda has genome type Aa. Assuming that a child of theirs also has a child with someone who also has genome type Aa, what is the probability that Bob and Linda's grandchild will have Genome type Aa? Write the answer as a percentage, rounding to the nearest integer if necessary.

Thought: Aa × Aa parents produce a child with genotype probabilities: AA 1/4, Aa 1/2, aa 1/4. That child then mates with an Aa individual. For each possible genotype of the child (AA, Aa, aa), the probability their offspring is Aa is 1/2. Therefore the overall probability is 1/2 = 50%. I will compute and return "50%".

<code>
# Compute probability
prob_child_genotypes = {"AA": 1/4, "Aa": 1/2, "aa": 1/4}
# For each child genotype, probability offspring (grandchild) is Aa when mated with Aa
prob_Aa_given_child = {"AA": 1/2, "Aa": 1/2, "aa": 1/2}

total_prob = sum(prob_child_genotypes[g] * prob_Aa_given_child[g] for g in prob_child_genotypes)

A pre-publication copy of The Lamp-Post Vol. 37, No. 2 (Fall/Winter 2019). "Emerging Scholars Edition"
—GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT—
The Lamp-Post will now publish bi-annually
Since its inception, The Lamp-Post has striven to publish quarterly. With this current issue, the journal will begin publishing bi-annually rather than quarterly. It is our hope that this will produce longer issues of greater quality, as well as keep costs manageable for our subscribers and society members.

For both Lewis and Jung, these archetypal patterns (or, more simply, archetypes) originated in God, but the former was much clearer about what sort of God mythology is rooted in.

Question Text:
An array of candy is set out to choose from including gumballs, candy corn, gumdrops, banana taffy, chocolate chips, and gummy bears. There is one bag of each type of candy. The gumballs come in red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and brown. The candy corn is yellow, white, and orange. The gumdrops are red, green, purple, yellow, and orange. The banana taffy is yellow. The chocolate chips are brown and white. The gummy bears are red, green, yellow, and orange. Five people pass through and each selects one bag. The first selects one with only primary colors. The second selects one with no primary colors. The third selects one with all the primary colors. The fourth selects one that has neither the most nor the least colors of the remaining bags. The fifth selects the one with their favorite color, green. A second bag of the candy the first person chose is added to the remaining bag of candy. Which two candies are in the remaining bag after the addition? Give me them in a comma separated list, in alphabetical order

### [MiroThinker: Pushing the Performance Boundaries of Open-Source Research Agents via Model, Context, and Interactive Scaling](/papers/2511.11793)

We present MiroThinker v1.0, an open-source research agent designed to advance tool-augmented reasoning and information-seeking capabilities. Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.

### [MiroThinker: Pushing the Performance Boundaries of Open-Source Research Agents via Model, Context, and Interactive Scaling](/papers/2511.11793)

We present MiroThinker v1.0, an open-source research agent designed to advance tool-augmented reasoning and information-seeking capabilities. Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.

Vodún, Vodu, or vodúnsínsen is an African traditional religion practiced by the Aja, Ewe, and Fon peoples of Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. There is no central authority in control of the religion and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as vodúnsɛntó or vodúnisants.
Vodún teaches the existence of a supreme creator divinity, under whom are lesser spirits called vodúns. Many of these deities are associated with specific areas, but others are venerated widely throughout West Africa; some have been absorbed from other religions, including Christianity and Hinduism. The vodún are believed to physically manifest in shrines and they are provided with offerings, typically including animal sacrifice. There are several all-male secret societies, including Oró and Egúngún, into which individuals receive initiation. Various forms of divination are used to gain information from the vodún, the most prominent of which is Fá, itself governed by a society of initiates.
The veneration of vodún spirits occurred in West Africa prior to the era of historical documentation. In the 18th century, Dahomey became a vassal state of the Oyo Empire, facilitating the westward transference of many Yoruba religious traditions to Fon and Ewe populations. This has resulted in considerable overlap and similarity with Yoruba religion. Amid the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to the 19th century, vodúnsɛntó were among the enslaved Africans transported to the Americas. There, their traditional religions influenced the development of new religions such as Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, and Brazilian Candomblé Jejé. Attempted suppression of Vodún came with the Christianisation projects of the 19th century and Benin's Marxist government of the mid-20th century. Since the 1990s, there have been growing efforts to encourage foreign tourists to visit West Africa and receive initiation into Vodún.
Many vodúnsɛntó practice their traditional religion alongside Christianity, for instance

class SGDClassifier(BaseSGDClassifier):
"""Linear classifiers (SVM, logistic regression, etc.) with SGD training.
This estimator implements regularized linear models with stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) learning: the gradient of the loss is estimated
each sample at a time and the model is updated along the way with a
decreasing strength schedule (aka learning rate). SGD allows minibatch
(online/out-of-core) learning via the `partial\_fit` method.
For best results using the default learning rate schedule, the data should
have zero mean and unit variance.
This implementation works with data represented as dense or sparse arrays
of floating point values for the features. The model it fits can be
controlled with the loss parameter; by default, it fits a linear support
vector machine (SVM).
The regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model
parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared euclidean norm
L2 or the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both (Elastic Net). If the
parameter update crosses the 0.0 value because of the regularizer, the
update is truncated to 0.0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieve
online feature selection.
Read more in the :ref:`User Guide `.
Parameters
----------
loss : {'hinge', 'log\_loss', 'log', 'modified\_huber', 'squared\_hinge',\
'perceptron', 'squared\_error', 'huber', 'epsilon\_insensitive',\
'squared\_epsilon\_insensitive'}, default='hinge'
The loss function to be used.
- 'hinge' gives a linear SVM.
- 'log\_loss' gives logistic regression, a probabilistic classifier.
- 'modified\_huber' is another smooth loss that brings tolerance to
outliers as well as probability estimates.
- 'squared\_hinge' is like hinge but is quadratically penalized.
- 'perceptron' is the linear loss used by the perceptron algorithm.
- The other losses, 'squared\_error', 'huber', 'epsilon\_insensitive' and
'squared\_epsilon\_insensitive' are designed for regression but can be useful
in classification as well; see

Scarlett's shearwater (Puffinus spelaeus) (Māori: Ōiruki) is an extinct species of seabird in the petrel family Procellariidae.  Its common name commemorates New Zealand palaeontologist Ron Scarlett, who recognised the bird's subfossil remains represented a distinct species.
This bird was described from bones collected in 1991 from a cave near the Fox River in the South Island of New Zealand. Subsequent discoveries of bones dating from 20,000 years ago to less than 600 years old reveal it was found only in the west and northwest of the South Island, in Northwest Nelson and Buller. Scarlett's shearwater was closely related to the fluttering shearwater (P. gavia) and Hutton's shearwater (P. huttoni), and DNA evidence from fossil bones show that all three had a common ancestor about 1 million years ago. It was smaller than its relatives, with an estimated weight of 250 g, and had the short wings characteristic of the fluttering shearwater. P. spelaeus is most likely to have been driven to extinction by a combination of exploitation by humans and predation by kiore/Polynesian rat Rattus exulans, which was introduced by Polynesians to New Zealand about 750 years ago.

I'll check the 26 April 2022 archived Wikipedia page for Scarlett's shearwater (Puffinus spelaeus) and inspect its references to find any author whose initials form a palindrome.

The relevant 2022 archived page lists references including authors such as R. N. Holdaway, T. H. Worthy, A. J. D. Tennyson, and L. D. Shepherd. None of those have palindromic initials (e.g., A.J.D. → AJD; R.N. → RN; L.D. → LD; T.H. → TH), and no other referenced author on that 2022 snapshot had initials that read the same forwards and backwards.

Therefore there is no reference author on the last 2022 Wikipedia version of the Scarlett's shearwater page whose initials are a palindrome.

Question Text:
Suppose a dog can split into two dogs to make two slightly smaller dogs 75% the weight of the original dog.

I have a 180-pound dog and I define a teacup dog as a dog under 4 pounds. The dog splits itself. Then, the resulting dogs split themselves. The splitting repeats until all the resulting dogs are teacup dogs. How many teacup dogs will there be?

Thought: The Statista page is paywalled and the numeric values weren't extractable. I'll search other public sources for annual U.S. retail egg price per dozen (1995–2022) — e.g., USDA, BLS, or news sites — extract the yearly prices, find prices that repeat in at least two years, then pick the highest two years among those and return the price formatted to two decimals.

Onomatopoeia is a type of word, or the process of creating a word, that phonetically imitates, resembles, or suggests the sound that it describes. Common onomatopoeias in English include animal noises such as oink, meow, roar, and chirp, among other sounds such as beep or hiccup.
Onomatopoeia can differ by language: it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system. Hence, the sound of a clock may be expressed variously across languages: as tick tock in English, tic tac in Spanish and Italian (see photo),  dī dā in Mandarin, kachi kachi in Japanese, or ṭik-ṭik in Hindi, Urdu, and Bengali.


== Etymology and terminology ==
The word onomatopoeia, with rarer spelling variants like onomatopeia and onomatopœia, is an English word from the Ancient Greek compound  ὀνοματοποιία, onomatopoiía, meaning 'name-making', composed of ὄνομα, ónoma, meaning "name"; and ποιέω, poiéō, meaning "making". It is pronounced  . Words that imitate sounds can thus be said to be onomatopoeic, onomatopoetic, imitative, or echoic.


== Uses ==

In the case of a frog croaking, the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds: Ancient Greek brekekekex koax koax (only in Aristophanes' comic play The Frogs) probably for marsh frogs; English ribbit for species of frog found in North America; English verb croak for the common frog.
Some other very common English-language examples are hiccup, zoom, bang, beep, moo, and splash. Machines and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia: honk or beep-beep for the horn of an automobile, and vroom or brum for the internal combustion engine. In speaking of a mishap involving an audible arcing of electricity, the word zap is often used (and its use has been extended to describe non-auditory effects of interference).
Human sounds sometimes provide instances of onomatopoeia, as when mwah is used to represent a kiss.
For animal sounds, words like quack (duck), moo (cow), bark or woof (dog), roar (lion), meow/miaow or purr (cat), cluck (chicken) and baa (sheep) are typically used in English (both as nouns and as verbs).
Some languages flexibly integrate onomatopoeic words into their structure. This may evolve into a new word, up to the point that the process is no longer recognized as onomatopoeia. One example is the English word bleat for sheep noise: in medieval times it was pronounced approximately as blairt (but without an R-component), or blet with the vowel drawled, which more closely resembles a sheep noise than the modern pronunciation.
An example of the opposite case is cuckoo, which, due to continuous familiarity with the bird noise down the centuries, has kept approximately the same pronunciation as in Anglo-Saxon times and its vowels have not changed as they have in the word furrow.
Verba dicendi ('words of saying') are a method of integrating onomatopoeic words and ideophones into grammar.
Sometimes, things are named from the sounds they make. In Engli

=== ARTICLE TEXT ===Linkin Park is an American rock band formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. The lineup for the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon; after Bennington's suicide in July 2017, the band endured a seven-year hiatus, during which Bourdon chose to depart from the band. In September 2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.
Categorized mainly as alternative rock and nu metal, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, with their later music featuring more electronica and pop elements. Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led to the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling", and "In the End" all charting highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the number two spot on the nation's Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success. The band's third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007), marked a change in sound. By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.
The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, while their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. The band's eighth album, From Zero (2024), returned to more of their original sound while also incorporating musical elements from all of their previous records.
Linkin Park is one of the best-selling music acts of all time, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, seven American Music Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, fou

Oganesson is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Og and atomic number 118. It was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, near Moscow, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. It was formally named on 28 November 2016. The name honors the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, who played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table.
Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element, a member of group 18, and the last member of period 7. Its only known isotope, oganesson-294, is highly radioactive, with a half-life of 0.7 ms. This half-life is too short for chemical studies. Because of relativistic effects, theoretical studies predict that it

Abstract
--------

Penguin is a Macintosh computer application that facilitates the use of CALIB 3.03, the 14C age calibration program by Stuiver and Reimer (1993). Penguin offers an easy user interface based on the well-known Macintosh standard multiwindow environment to create and edit the CALIB 3.03 calibration files and to export data in text format. Penguin and CALIB interact at the file level, i.e., Penguin is capable of reading and writing files in CALIB formats. Files containing the data are created in the Penguin environment and then saved on disk in the Penguin format. Penguin allows multiple editing of the calibration parameters and recalibration of the list of samples without the need to insert any modifications manually throughout the list. Penguin can also be used to read already calibrated files in order to e

Execution logs:
The black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), also called the black rhino or the hooked-lip rhinoceros, is a species of rhinoceros native to East and Southern Africa, including Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although the species is referred to as black, its colours vary from brown to grey. It is the only extant species of the genus Diceros.
The other rhinoceros native to Africa is the white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum). The word "white" in the name "white rhinoceros" is often said to be a misinterpretation of the Afrikaans word wyd (Dutch wijd) meaning wide, referring to its square upper lip, as opposed to the pointed or hooked lip of the black rhinoceros. These species are now sometimes referred to as the square-lipped (for white) or hook-lipped (for black) rhinoceros.
The species overall is classified as critically endangered (even though the south-western black rhinoceros is classified as near threatened) and is threatened by multiple factors including poaching and habitat reduction.  Three subspecies have been declared extinct, including the western black rhinoceros, which was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2011. The IUCN estimates that 3,142 mature individuals remain in the wild.


== Taxonomy ==
The species was first named Rhinoceros bicornis by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema naturae in 1758. The name means "double-horned rhinoceros". There is some confusion about what exactly Linnaeus conceived under this name as this species was probably based upon the skull of a single-horned Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), with a second horn artificially added by the collector. Such a skull is known to have existed and Linnaeus even mentioned India as origin of this species. However he also referred to reports from early travellers about a double-horned rhino in Africa and when it emerged that there is only one, single-horned species of rhino in India, Rhinoceros bicornis was used to refer to the African rhinos (the white rhino only became recognised in 1812). In 1911 this was formally fixed and the Cape of Good Hope officially declared the type locality of the species.


=== Subspecies ===
The intraspecific variation in the black rhinoceros has been discussed by various authors and is not finally settled. The most accepted scheme considers seven or eight subspecies, Its Somalian range was the last to be eradicated, the subspecies becoming extinct sometime in the early 20th century. of which three became extinct in historical times and one is on the brink of extinction:

Southern black rhinoceros or Cape black rhinoceros (D. b. bicornis) – Extinct. Once abundant from the Cape of Good Hope to Transvaal, South Africa and probably into the south of Namibia, this was the largest subspecies. It became extinct due to excessive hunting and habitat destruction around 1850.

I can't confidently retrieve that BibTeX key right now because PhilPapers is blocking automated access (I get 403 errors) and public search results don't show the record ID. I can try again if you either

- paste the PhilPapers record URL or the BibTeX text here, or
- allow me to attempt another live lookup.

If you want a tentative (unconfirmed) guess based on PhilPapers' usual ID pattern for Jane Duran items, it might be DURYOR — but I can't verify that without access.

Question Text:
As of the end of July 2023, how many other rail lines did Amtrak’s Adirondack line provide connections to? Count only commuter/heavy rail lines that share a station with the Adirondack, not subway or light rail lines.

Thought: I'll search for the Amtrak Adirondack route page (likely Wikipedia) to find its stations and any listed connections, then inspect each station to count shared commuter/heavy rail lines (excluding subways/light rail). I'll use wikipedia_get_page to retrieve the Adirondack article, print station list, then visit pages for stations that likely have commuter/heavy rail (e.g., New York Penn Station, Albany–Rensselaer, Plattsburgh, etc.) and count distinct commuter/heavy rail lines that share a station with the Adirondack as of end of July 2023. I'll print intermediate findings and then return the final count.

The Russell Sage Foundation is an American non-profit organisation established by Margaret Olivia Sage in 1907 for “the improvement of social and living conditions in the United States.” It was named after her recently deceased husband, railroad executive Russell Sage. The foundation dedicates itself to strengthening the methods, data, and theoretical core of the social sciences to better understand societal problems and develop informed responses. It supports visiting scholars in residence and publishes books and a journal under its own imprint. It also funds researchers at other institutions and supports programs intended to develop new generations of social scientists. The foundation focuses on labor markets, immigration and ethnicity, and social inequality in the United States, as well as behavioral economics.

> Abstract:This paper is a submission to the Open Philanthropy AI Worldviews Contest. In it, we estimate the likelihood of transformative artificial general intelligence (AGI) by 2043 and find it to be <1%.
>   
> Specifically, we argue:
>   
> The bar is high: AGI as defined by the contest - something like AI that can perform nearly all valuable tasks at human cost or less - which we will call transformative AGI is a much higher bar than merely massive progress in AI, or even the unambiguous attainment of expensive superhuman AGI or cheap but uneven AGI.
>   
> Many steps are needed: The probability of transformative AGI by 2043 can be decomposed as the joint probability of a number of necessary steps, which we group into categories of software, hardware, and sociopolitical factors.
>   
> No step is guaranteed: For each step, we estimate a probability of success by 2043, conditional on prior steps being achieved. Many steps are quite constrained by the short timeline, and our estimates range from 16% to 95%.
>   
> Therefore, the odds are low: Multiplying the cascading conditional probabilities together, we estimate that transformative AGI by 2043 is 0.4% likely. Reaching >10% seems to requ

[Gluconeogenesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis)
Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway that results in the biosynthesis of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates. It is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms.

[What process transfers glucose into pyruvate ? - Answers](https://www.Answers.com/biology/What_process_transfers_glucose_into_pyruvate)
The process by which glucose is turned into pyruvate is called glycolysis. In this process the six carbon (6C) glucose molecule is split into two (3C) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphates at an energy cost of 2 (2 ATPs are used up).

[Pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase.](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)54585-3/pdf)
Both pyruvate carboxylation via pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate decar-boxylation via pyruvate dehydrogenase appear to be influ-enced by glucose .drogenase, carbons 3 and 4 of glucose (which become carbon . 1 of pyruvate ) are released as CO9 in the pyruvate dehydro

[What Two Carbon Precursor Molecule For Carbohydrate Metabolism](https://trudtox.com/which-two-molecules-are-carbon-precursors-for-the-metabolism-of.html)
In the overall glycolytic process, one molecule of glucose is converted to two molecules of pyruvate , which is the pathway of carbon . Two critical entry points for carbon into the Krebs cycle are pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and α-ketoglutarate.

[A flow chart and simple explanation of the Glycolysis pathway | Traverse](https://traverse.link/community/glycolysis)
During glycolysis, glucose is transformed into pyruvate . Glucose is a six - carbon ring molecule found in blood, typically produced by breaking down carbohydrates into sugars.

Question Text:
I have a fun card game that we can play together! Here are the rules: I'll draw a certain number of cards and then arrange them in a certain order in a stack, face down. After I do that, I'll describe a series of steps, and your job will be to keep track of the cards and answer a question about the final ordering.

Okay, from top to bottom, here's the starting layout:

2 of clubs
3 of hearts
King of spades
Queen of hearts
Jack of clubs
Ace of diamonds

Now, here are the steps I'm taking to jumble up the stack.

I take the top three cards and place them at the bottom of the stack.
I take the top card and place it under the second card.
I take the top two cards and place them under the third card.
I take the bottom card and place it on top of the stack.
I take the top two cards and place them under the third card.
I take the top four cards and place them on the bottom of the stack.
I take the bottom card and place it on the top of the stack.
I take the top two cards and place them on the bottom of the stack.
I take the bottom card and place it on the top of the stack.


What is the top card on the stack? If the card's name contains a digit, write the digit in plain text when answering, e.g. 'six of spades' instead of '6 of spades'.

Thought: I'll simulate the stack operations in Python. I'll treat phrases like "place them under the third card" as referring to the original nth card (i.e., insert the moved cards immediately after the nth card in the original ordering). I'll print the deck after each step so we can trace it, then return the final top card using words for digits (e.g., "two" rather than "2").

Abstract
--------

Detailed information on the distribution and abundance of animals is often difficult to establish for rare and elusive species. Here we report on genetic analyses confirming the presence of the Kam dwarf hamster 500 km north of its known distribution in China where it was earlier thought to be endemic. Our finding was made during a study on disease ecology in southern Mongolia and illustrates the benefit of genetic approaches when studying rare and elusive species or species that are either difficult to identify or do not elicit public or scientific attention. We suggest that larger ranges than currently known may be a common pattern for a number of rare and elusive species because of ineffective survey methods and lack of sampling effort.

Opening additional plants is more important than obtaining raw materials and brainstorming new paperweights, upgrading old machinery is more important than one other goal only, and the manager thinks that optimizing production efficiency is less important than brainstorming new paperweights but more important than obtaining raw materials but has the order backwards. Hiring new workers is more important than three other goals, doing performance reviews is more important than hiring new workers but less important than optimizing production efficiency, and finding investors is less important than obtaining raw materials. What is the second most important goal (return it exactly as given in the question)?

Thought:
I'll reason through the constraints to produce a consistent ranking. From the clues we deduce the unique second-most-important goal is "Obtain raw materials." I'll show the inferred ordering briefly and then return the required answer.

Data was compared to a recent gallup performed on a sample of all dogs in Sweden. The demographic statistics of the insured dog population were in many aspects similar to the total dog population of Sweden. Typical for both insured do

Thought: I'll search the already-fetched article HTML (variable page) for Table 1 or links to a separate tables page. I'll parse the HTML with BeautifulSoup to find any table elements or links like '/tables/1' and print them so I can then visit the table page if needed.

<code>
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

soup = BeautifulSoup(page, "html.parser")
# Look for links that might point to tables
table_links = []
for a in soup.find_all("a", href=True):
    href = a["href"]
    if re.search(r"/tables?/", href) or re.search(r"Table\s*1", a.get_text(), re.I):
        table_links.append((href, a.get_text().strip()))

# Look for any inline table elements or captions mentioning Table 1
tables = soup.find_all("table")

for t in tables:
    cap = t.find("caption")
    captions.append(cap.get_text().strip() if cap else "no caption")

# Also search the raw HTML for "Table 1" occurrences

Chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground cocoa beans that can be a liquid, solid, or paste, either by itself or to flavor other foods. Cocoa beans are the processed seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). They are usually fermented to develop the flavor, then dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to reveal nibs, which are ground to chocolate liquor: unadulterated chocolate in rough form. The liquor can be processed to separate its two components, cocoa solids and cocoa butter, or shaped and sold as unsweetened baking chocolate. By adding sugar, sweetened chocolates are produced, which can be sold simply as dark chocolate, or, with the addition of milk, can be made into milk chocolate. Making milk chocolate with cocoa butter and without cocoa solids produces white chocolate.

Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including ice creams, cakes, mousse, and cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, and coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate and chocolate liqueur.

d. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste is unaffected. Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.
Chocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb aromas. To avoid this, chocolate is packed or wrapped, then stored in darkness, in ideal humidity and temperature conditions.


== Health effects ==


=== Nutrition ===
One hundred grams of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).
One hundred grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10–19% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.


=== Phytochemicals ===

Chocolate contains polyphenols, especially flavan-3-ols (catechins) and smaller amounts of other flavonoids. It also contains alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine, which are under study for their potential effects in the body.


=== Heavy metals ===

It is unlikely that chocolate consumption in small amounts causes lead poisoning. Some studies have shown that lead may bind to cocoa shells, and contamination may occur during the manufacturing process. One study showed the mean lead level in milk chocolate candy bars was 0.027 μg lead per gram of candy. Another study found that some chocolate purchased at U.S. supermarkets contained up to 0.965 μg per gram, close to the international (voluntary) standard limit for lead in cocoa powder or beans, which is 1 μg of lead per gram. 
In 2006, the U.S. FDA lowered by one-fifth the amount of lead permissible in candy, but compliance is only volu
